## Title of the Project

Ai driven mock interview assistant using Siamese Network
## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
An AI-driven mock interview assistant, like the one you're developing, leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to simulate realistic interview scenarios, allowing users to practice and improve their interview skills

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Implements advance neural network method.
- A framework based application for deployment purpose.
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
- A specific scope of Chatbot response model, using json data format.

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
* Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
* Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
* IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
* Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow (versions 2.4.1), TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.

## Results and Impact

<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The similarity score of the model when we use cosine similarity we will get high score regarding the similarity score, where as when we use the siamese network we will get much more similarity score because siamese network considers overall context of the sentence.
